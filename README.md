## Local Development

Environment requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18.0.0+

### 1. Enable corepack & pnpm

> If your Node.js version is lower than 16.13.0，Please install [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) first.
>
> ```shell
> npm install -g corepack
> ```

```shell
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
```

### 2. Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cworld1/ccp-learning.git
cd ccp-learning
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```shell
pnpm install
```

### 3. Start the development server

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### 4. Some useful commands

`pnpm run build`
Bundles your website into static files for production.

## Contributions

As the author is only a beginner in learning Computer Composition Principle, there are obvious mistakes in his notes. Readers are also invited to make a lot of mistakes. In addition, you are welcome to use PR or Issues to improve them.

## Thanks

Some of the electronic textbooks have helped the author a lot in his studies, and without them, this notebook would not have been possible. I would like to express my gratitude to the original authors of these materials. If you have any doubts about this project, you can also read the following textbooks carefully to remedy them.
